This is a metronome response task program created in summer 2019. It has been edited from its original form to remove study-specific details.

<ul>This program was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP to meet the following specifications: 
  <li>-Exclude / redirect participants using mobile phones</li>
  <li>-Exclude / redirect participants using browsers other than Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Opera</li>
  <li>-Obtain participant consent or redirect</li>
  <li>-Test participant equipment to verify that the metronome sound plays and keyboard presses are recorded</li>
  <li>-Present detailed task instructions and show probe question examples</li>
  <li>-Run participants through a number of practice MRT trials and give feedback</li>
  <li>-Run participants through a number of test MRT trials</li>
  <li>-Ask participant mind wandering level a number of times, randomly and evenly distributed among the trials</li>
  <li>-Ask participant motivation level a number of times, presented during predetermined trials</li>
  <li>-Present one captcha meant to filter out the use of bots</li>
  <li>-Obtain participant demographic information</li>
  <li>-Save individual participant data as .txt files and add participant ids to a running participant list</li>
  <li>-Return assigned verification code and present debriefing information</li>
  <li>-Provide a feedback form and save these responses separately to ensure anonymity if desired</li>
</ul>

<ul>The MRT itself was programmed as follows: 
  <li>-Each trial lasted 1300 ms with an mp3 file of a metronome sound playing halfway through each trial</li>
  <li>-Participants pressed the spacebar on their keyboard as quickly as possible each time the sound played</li>
  <li>-Response time, trial number, omission rate, and start and end times were recorded, among other variables</li>
</ul>
